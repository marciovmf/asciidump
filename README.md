# asciidump

## What ?
This is a very simple program that dumps ASCII from bitmaps

## Why ?
I was bored.

## How to build ?
The project uses a very simple cmake file. There are no dependecies.

## How to use ?
simply run the program passing the path to the bitmap file you want to dump. I suggest redirecting stdout to a file with ">" 

````adump your_bmp_file.bmp > out_file.txt````
